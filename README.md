This project predicts Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock prices using Python and Linear Regression, demonstrating how machine learning can analyze stock market trends based on historical data. It focuses on visualizing Tesla’s stock price trends, building a Linear Regression model, evaluating its performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE), and providing a simple introduction to machine learning for beginners.
Using tools like Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and scikit-learn, the project works with historical Tesla stock data containing Date, Open, High, Low, Close prices, Adjusted Close, and Volume. The workflow includes loading and cleaning the data, creating interactive graphs for visualization, training the Linear Regression model, evaluating its accuracy, and comparing actual versus predicted stock prices. Key insights involve cleaning and analyzing data, building models, visualizing trends, and measuring prediction accuracy.
Future improvements could include testing advanced models, adding more features like news sentiment, and expanding to predict multiple stocks or create a dashboard. The project repository and graphs are available for reference. Let me know if you’d like more details!
